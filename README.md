# SharedEvolutionSocialMicrobiomes
This project contains the code to simulate evolution under mutation-selection-migration and genetic drift. The model was used to predict the effect of bacterial transmission on the landscape of mutations shared among populations of E. coli colonizing the gut of mice (Frazao, N. and Gordo, I. 2023).
